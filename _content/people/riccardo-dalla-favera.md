The research program in the Dalla-Favera laboratory is aimed at the identification of the molecular pathogenesis of human B cell malignancies. Functional and structural genomic approaches are used toward the identification of the genetic lesions leading to the transformation of B lymphocytes. The genomic landscape of the tumors is then recapitulated in genetically modified mice in order to construct models for pre-clinical testing of science-based new therapeutic modalities.
